# Arcadium - Music Sharing on the Social Web

This is a work-in-progress effort to build a social music sharing service for the Fediverse, built on top of [Emissary](https://emissary.dev), the social web toolkit.

Nothing works just yet, but you may be interested to watch it grow - especially if you're thinking about building your own  templates.
