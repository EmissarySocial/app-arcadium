# Planetary.fm - Music Sharing on the Social Web

Planetary is a social music sharing service for the Fediverse. Built for bands, Planetary is a customizable home page for all your songs, show dates, photos, and announcements.  

## Build with Emissary
Planetary is a small social app build on [Emissary, the social web toolkit](https://emissary.dev). You must [install Emissary](https://emissary.dev/installation) on a server first, before using Planetary.

### Installing
To install Planetary.fm on your own Emissary server, just open your Emissary setup console, navigate to Server Settings > Packages, and add a new Git adapter that points to: https://github.com/EmissarySocial/app-planetary.git

### Customizing
Planetary consists of a new custom profile page (or, outbox) and templates for a handful of new content types that each band can post: albums, show dates, photos, and announcements.  After installing Planetary, each band can customize the colors, images, and labels used in their own profile.
